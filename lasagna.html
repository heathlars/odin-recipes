        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375° F. Butter a 9x13 inch pan.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, melt together the butter, garlic, sage, rosemary, fennel, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Cook 3-4 minutes, until the butter is lightly browning. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Add the milk and broth. Season with salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Stir in the Gruyère/fontina cheese, 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese, and the nutmeg. Stir until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl combine the ricotta, provolone, spinach, pesto, and egg. Season with pepper.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/4 of the cheese sauce in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with 3-4 lasagna sheets. Spread with 1/2 the ricotta cheese mixture and another 1/4 of the cheese sauce. Repeat the layering. Repeat the layering until all the sauce has been used...don't stress about making it perfect. Top with a 1/2 cup of parmesan.</li>
            <li>Bake covered for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake another 15-20 minutes, until the top has bubbled up and browned a bit. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
