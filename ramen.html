        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is quick, but you have to know, the broth is really the star of this ramen. It’s so simple, but the combination of miso and chili paste is just something extra special. </p>
        <p>And of course, no bowl of ramen is complete without the toppings, they’re the best part after all, right? I do soft-boiled eggs, plenty of green onions, toasted nori sheets, and lots of chili oil.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 medium shallots</li>
            <li>1 inch ginger</li>
            <li>8 c chicken broth</li>
            <li>3/4 c coconut milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mis paste</li>
            <li>4 squares ramen</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the garlic, shallots, ginger, and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelized, about 3 minutes. Pour in the broth, milk, and soy sauce, then whisk in the miso and chili paste. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>o the soup, stir in the noodles, spinach, and sesame oil. Let sit 5 minutes or until the noodles are soft. </li>
            <li>To serve, divide the noodles between bowls and ladle over the soup back overtop. Add the chicken. Top as desired with eggs, green onions, sesame seeds, and chili oil. Serve immediately.</li>
